UAV 2D Hover Simulation – Arieal Mini Project

A lightweight research-style simulation demonstrating UAV dynamics, stabilization, and data analysis.

This project was developed as part of my interest in UAV
The goal was to design a simple but complete workflow that shows capability in:

UAV simulation

Control system fundamentals

Python based modeling

Data visualization & analysis

Research-style documentation

Despite being a small project, it follows : 
simulate → verify → analyze → optimize.
